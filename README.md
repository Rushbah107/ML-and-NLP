# ML-and-NLP
This project serves as proof of my work and learning in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It demonstrates how I have applied ML techniques to real-world text data using NLP methods such as data cleaning, text vectorization with GloVe embeddings, and sentiment classification using machine learning models.
